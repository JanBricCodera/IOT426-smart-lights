# IOT426-smart-lights
A project created with the goal to employ automation using social media.
The unit is an embedded system that allows you to control section of your home lights remotely using a twitter account. 
Technologies used: Python, C, Fujitsu MCU

## Features:
1. Live tweet scanning
2. Activity Log
3. Twitter software interpreter
4. LCD status display
5. Implementation of the electrical circuitry

## Conceptual framework.

## Hardware Design
The hardware consists primarily of a Fujitsu microcontroller and the subsequent sensors. A PC/laptop running the tweet interpreter application would be able to send signals to the MCU through the RS-232 converter cable. The signal being sent to the MCU has a unique value that determines how a specific light switches. The status of the four lights are displayed in the LCD. 

## Software Design

The tweet interpreter program is designed with the use of the python software with additional libraries installed for the pythonâ€“twitter integration. The tweet interpreter will send a signal to the MCU through the serial port with a value from 1-8. Each value sent will be received by the MCU and will decode and respond to how each of the individual lights will perform.


## Data Presentation and Analysis

The table below shows the operation and interpretation of signals sent from the transmitter(Python) to the receiver side(C).

Based on the table above, the receiver side identifies the value transmitted as hex values. As it confirms that the microcontroller receives a match on a certain hex value, it will perform a specific output task.
